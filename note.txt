Dear receiver,
I use java for the solution for some reasons:
1. I am not familiar with golang.
2. I think I can not use springboot and map every json entity to corresponding "pre defined" class due
   to requirement "the solution should be flexible for any yaml files".
3. Junit used in this project will assert if returned object of this "core" function is JSONObject.
4. I assume that for each field defined in yaml , if no environment variable match with the field, then
   Json result will display original text such :
   "client"=${$SQL_CLIENT}
